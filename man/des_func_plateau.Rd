\title{Test desirability functions}
\usage{
des_func_plateau(mod, XX, return_se = F, N_add = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{mod}{GP model}

\item{XX}{Points to evaluate at}

\item{return_se}{whether the se prediction should be returned along with
the des, all will be returned in data.frame, this will save
time if calculating the werror function since it is faster
to predict both at once instead of separately}

\item{N_add}{Number of points to add}
}

A des func for finding plateau
